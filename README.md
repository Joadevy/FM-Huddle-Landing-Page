## Overview
This is my solution to the [Huddle landing page challenge of Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100). 

### The challenge

- Reply the design of the component as well as possible and make it responsive for 375px and 1440px resolutions.

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS for nesting, module and custom properties.

### What I learned

This is my second complete landing page coded 100% for me. 
I used SASS to nesting and partials in order to module my code. I used a pattern to organize the project like an architecture but adapted for this small web.
I learned more about code reutilization, I used it with the articles of the page and buttons. I learned a little bit of design also and I like it.
I'll keep working on it.

### Continued development

I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially about going into javascript in order to create dynamic webs. I want to learn git too because it's important and useful for co-working. I'll working on that when I feel confortable with my HTML/CSS skills.
